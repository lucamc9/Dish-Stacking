Dish Stacking with Reinforcement Learning
=========================================

This is the code for the tutorial called "Dish Stacking with Reinforcement Learning" from the 2017/18 Reinforcement Learning class at the UoE.
The task is to model the following scenario as an RL problem and solve using classical RL algorithms:

"A domestic assistance robot needs to stack dishes from a dishwasher. It can grab and hold a dish
from the washer or it can store a held dish in the cupboard. It can complete both perfectly with no
chance of error. Unfortunately, the dishwasher is broken and hasn't dried any of the plates and the
reward for storing dry plates in the cupboard (10) is larger than storing wet plates (5). The robot can
attempt to dry any held plate but has a small chance of breaking the plate (pf =0.1) which carries a
heavy cost (-20). The robot will also drop and break a held plate (-20) if it decides to grab a new one
from the dishwasher. The robot now needs to try and determine which policy to choose for this task. "

The code comprises questions 2A)-F).
